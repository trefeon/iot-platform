# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Simple IoT Platform

## ✅ What Changed

Your IoT platform has been **simplified** and is now **portfolio-ready**!

### 📁 New Structure
```
iot-platform/
├── main.py                    # Simple FastAPI application
├── requirements.txt           # Minimal dependencies
├── docker-compose.yml         # Simplified deployment
├── Dockerfile                # Clean container setup
├── static/                   # Beautiful dashboard
├── config/                   # MQTT configuration
├── firmware/
│   ├── esp32-sensor.ino      # Arduino IDE ready ESP32 code
│   └── ESP32_ARDUINO_SETUP.md # Detailed Arduino IDE setup
├── data/                     # SQLite database storage
└── setup.sh                 # Ubuntu server setup script
```

## 🎯 What You Gained

✅ **Cleaner codebase** - Easy to understand and explain to employers  
✅ **Faster deployment** - 3 commands to get running  
✅ **Better documentation** - Professional README and setup guide  
✅ **Portfolio-focused** - Shows real skills without unnecessary complexity  
✅ **Production-ready** - Docker, security, monitoring included  

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test Locally
```bash
cd "e:\Coding\Signature Portfolio Project\iot-platform"

# Start the platform
docker-compose up -d

# Check it's running
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### 2. Configure ESP32
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Install required libraries (see `firmware/ESP32_ARDUINO_SETUP.md`)
3. Open `firmware/esp32-sensor.ino`
4. Update WiFi credentials and server IP
5. Flash to your ESP32

### 3. View Dashboard
- Local: http://localhost:8000
- Shows real-time sensor data from ESP32

### 4. Set Up Public Access (Optional)
1. Get a Cloudflare account
2. Create a tunnel for your domain
3. Update `.env.example` → `.env` with your tunnel token
